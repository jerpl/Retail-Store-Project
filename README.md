# Retail-Store-Project

This is a backend project focusing on the major technical components of online retail stores such as Search engine Optimization (SEO), web crawling, and recommender systems. The project consists of two separate components; a web crawler and a recommender system. Assuming the retail system consists of a network of users and products. The goal of the web crawler was to provide the basis of a search engine for products in the store database. It displays the most relevant pages related to a keyword using SEO principles such as indexing, PageRank, and TF-IDF rating. The goal of the recommender system portion was to implement efficient algorithms for predicting user preferences based on their historical data. By using techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation, the system is able to assess its prediction accuracy over thousands of items in a matter of seconds and recalculate its user ratings and rating deviations based on the validation results. Runtime optimization was paramount as the sample set consisted of thousands of items and users, thus a lot of time was put into precomputation and data storage to prevent needless operations which would add up to minutes of runtime over larger datasets. This project was important to my development as an engineer as the technical challenges and emphasis on validation and runtime exposed my weaknesses as a developer and demanded improvement.
